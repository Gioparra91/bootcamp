# Until Academy Launch

This repo will be under construction. If you are looking at it, it's probably because you
are an instructor and you should take a look at the following works of the Pedro Fonseca
for the guidelines:

- [Guide to build SLUs](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/Guide-to-building-Learning-Units)
- [Guide to use nbgrader](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/Using-nbgrader-for-Exercise-Notebooks)

How to proceed (it's very simple)

1. Create a new directory `units/SLU6_<name-of-unit>`
2. Add the notebook and exercises into the directory you just created
3. When it's ready for review, ping the person that is assigned to review
   your learning unit.


## What is this repo?

This repo contains a series of Learning Units. A Learning Unit is one hour of material
meant to convey a few related concepts in the form of

- a short (<15 min) presentation
- some example notebooks
- some practice exercises

During the academy, we will be going through these one-by-one listening
to the instructors give their short presentations, checking out the examples,
and doing the practice exercises.
